## Concept 2 : Temporal Dead Zone

In JS, let and const variable type are scriter in terms of declaration.
var keyword is hoisted and is initialized as `undefined`
const and let keyword are also hoisted but they are not initialized until referenced/called. This leads to the 
generation of `temporal dead zone` which leads to error in case let or const variables are called before initialisation.
